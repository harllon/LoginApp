# LoginApp
This is a Login App that I'm currently doing for my research at Texas Tech University.
In this app we have two kinds of users: The normal user and the admin user. We can register both kind of users but, we have the condition that only admin users could register another admin user. For each user we will be able to access some sensors. The first one developed was the access to GPS sensor. We can track our latitude and longitude in real time and these informations are saved in another room database and displayed using RecyclerView. 
The main part of this work was to learn how to use exactly the room database available in android to store all the informations needed about the users.



More features will be added in the future.
